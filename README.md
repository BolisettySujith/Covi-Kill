# **Introduction**👨‍💻
In the initial stages of covid-19 vaccine testing trails, doctors are testing with many vaccines for discovering a cure for covid-19, at that stage it became difficult for the doctors to give a proper vaccine to their patients. So taking this part as an inspiration to provide a vaccine to their patient in difficulit situations. Covi Kill is a simple interactive game which is available in Android, Web, Linux made using flutter.  

# **What it does**😎
In this game, doctor avatar need to play 5 levels to complete the whole game, as the levels increases the game hardness increases. The Doctor need to take the vaccine to the covid-19 effected patients, and cure them. There are some covid-19 patients, the doctor need to give them the vaccine to that patient, so by delivering the vaccine to the patient he will be cured.

## **Challenges I ran into**🤔
It was the first time to Build an responsive app, so it was Challenging to build an app like this.

## **Accomplishments that I'm proud of**😁
I really proud of building an app like this which is responsive with many more other awsome features and it teached me a lot of lessons while building this app.

## **What I have learned**😎
App State management is the biggest thing that I have learned while building this app, and learned creating animations using canvas as well as in Rive. The another biggest thing that I have learned is creating responsive apps. This app also made me learn many dart concepts and building some super cool logics which make the UI more iteractive.

## **What's next for Covi Kill** 🙃
At present this app is having 5 levels, so planning to extend the levels.
